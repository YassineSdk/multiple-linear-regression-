# multiple-linear-regression
Our primary objective is to create a precise linear regression model that can effectively predict student performance by considering multiple independent variables. We aim to achieve this by utilizing sophisticated statistical techniques to evaluate the correlation between the independent variables and identify the key factors that have the greatest impact on student performance. To ensure accuracy, we will conduct a meticulous analysis of the actual data compared to the predicted data utilizing various methods such as distribution plot, scatter plot, and metric measures like MSE and R squared. Through our rigorous methodology, we are confident that our model will yield invaluable insights into student performance.
